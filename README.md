## About
Media Tracker allows users to view all kinds of media (series, books, etc.) and add them to custom lists. While users may create separate lists such as "Shows To-Watch" or "Books I Recommend", the purpose of Media Tracker is to be an all-encompassing platform for any kind of media.

A fully-developed version of this application would likely include the ability to share lists or even build user profiles. Additionally, it would fetch media data from multiple APIs, rather than rely on hard-coded demo data.

*Please note that this application was initially developed in a group project alongside fellow student Lucas Pallone ([@PalloneL](https://github.com/PalloneL)), however it has since been greatly modified in order to further increase originality.*
