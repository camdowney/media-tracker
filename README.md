## About
Media Tracker allows users to view all kinds of media (series, books, etc.) and add them to custom lists. While users may create separate lists such as "Shows To-Watch" or "Books I Recommend", the purpose of Media Tracker is to be an all-encompassing platform for any kind of media.

A fully-developed version of this application would likely include the ability to share lists or even build user profiles. Additionally, it would fetch media data from multiple APIs, rather than rely on hard-coded demo data.

*While this application has been greatly refactored to increase originality, it was initially developed as a group project at UWF alongside Lucas Pallone.*
